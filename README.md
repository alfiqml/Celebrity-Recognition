# Celebrity-Recognition
Predictive Modeling for Celebrity Recognition Using Python Machine Learning Algorithm (CNN)

# Introduction
This group project demonstrates the prediction of Celebrity Recognition Using Python Machine Learning Algorithm (CNN). This datasets that obtained from Kaggle provides images of 5 celebrity (Elton John, Ben Affleck, Jerry Seinfield, Madonna and Mindy Kaling). The dataset was created to facilitate the illustration of CNN. Accurate prediction of celebrity is inconvenient and costly, making it desirable to have more accessible methods for predicting celebrity faces.

# Objectives
To build machine learning models using Convolutional Neural Network to predict celebrity face based on given image.

# Dataset
Data was made available by DANB from Kaggle website. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset)
